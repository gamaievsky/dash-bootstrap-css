# Example app

This example app showcases the custom stylesheets. It includes a toggle which
will turn on/off the custom styling so you can easily see the effect of using
the stylesheets in your app.


To run it, make sure you have `dash` and `dash-bootstrap-components` installed

```
pip install -U dash dash-bootstrap-components
```

Then simply copy one of the compiled stylesheets from `dist/` into
`examples/assets/` and run the app with

```
python app.py
```
